## Day 1
Coming up with ideas for the theme "Lost And Found". Instead of having the player losing things in the game and finding them again, one idea was to make others lose stuff and try to find or catch it. 

## Day 2
That's what the plot became: Aliens invade a small suburb and try to suck up people into their UFOs as samples of lifeforms alien to them. Fortunately, the mayor of the town is a military fan and placed a flak and some remote controlled helicopters on the towns central park for worship. These toys come in handy now. While the detonations of the flak's projectiles distort the UFOs tractor beams, making them loose the humans halfway up, the choppers can try to catch the citizens with a net spanning between them. Here's a first scribble.

In the evening, Elli and Monika already created some sprites and a first draft of the scenery

Ellie has sent some more sprites and a new background  
![](Docu/Background2.png)

The controls are pretty much done, so far solely with placeholders. The mouse controls a target point the crosshair slowly moves towards. On mouseclick, a flak projectile detonates at the crosshair position. The pack of helicopters is controlled by the keyboard. Starting and landing in the middle of the town is not implemented yet.

### 24.00 (0am)
Sounds edited and integrated! Time to sleep...

## Day 5 (Final)
It's 7.00 (7am), coffee is hot and a snack is prepared... let's get some villagers kidnapped.

### 11.00 (11am)
Ufos now suck up villagers with their tractor beam. When a flak projectile detonates near them, they wiggle and lose the villager they are about to suck. If they stabilize in time to find the villager again with the beam, the keep pulling them up. Otherwise... SPLAT!

### 13.00 (1pm)
Oh my god! Ellie created the most amazing title poster!

### 17.00 (5pm)
IT'S ALIVE!  
And the Global Game Jam is over. We managed to get a prototype working in time and uploaded to the [jamsite](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/ufoundlost-5)  

We had four teams in the Spiellabor (Gameslab), all of them presented their prototypes and designs. All of them are functional. [See them all](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/spiellabor-der-hochschule-furtwangen-university/games)

They were created using FUDGE, Unity, Unreal and Godot. The Godot-Export didn't work, so it was not uploaded, but the presentation was impressive. We had those on Twitch, see next paragraph.

# Presentations Global Game Jam Spiellabor 2021
After our uploads the teams met in discord to present the creations of the last few days. The meeting and presentations were done in German and streamed to Twitch. See
