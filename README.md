## Day 1
Coming up with ideas for the theme "Lost And Found". Instead of having the player losing things in the game and finding them again, one idea was to make others lose stuff and try to find or catch it. 

## Day 2
That's what the plot became: Aliens invade a small suburb and try to suck up people into their UFOs as samples of lifeforms alien to them. Fortunately, the mayor of the town is a military fan and placed a flak and some remote controlled helicopters on the towns central park for worship. These toys come in handy now. While the detonations of the flak's projectiles distort the UFOs traktor beams, making them loose the humans halfway up, the choppers can try to catch the citizens with a net spanning between them. Here's a first scribble.

In the evening, Elli and Monika already created some sprites and a first draft of the scenery
