    <h1>UfoundLost</h1>
    A 50’s B-movie alien invasion horror game made with FUDGE during the global game jam 2021. Theme: "Lost And
    Found". <br />
    Aliens invade a small suburb and try to suck up people into their UFOs as samples of lifeforms
    alien to them. Fortunately, the mayor of the town is a military fan and placed a flak and some remote controlled
    helicopters on the towns central park for worship. These toys come in handy now. While the detonations of the
    flak’s projectiles distort the UFOs tractor beams, making them loose the citizens halfway up, they will try to
    find them again before they hit the street falling. Or before you saved them with the net spanning between the
    choppers.
